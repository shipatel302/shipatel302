## The Short Version

> I am a **bioinformatician, data scientist, and statistical modeler** with 3+ years of experience.
> I build things that scale, run analyses that hold up under scrutiny,
> and communicate findings that people actually understand and use.

**The data I work with:** single-cell RNA-seq · bulk RNA-seq · whole genome & exome · proteomics · HTS compound screens · clinical records · multi-omics

**The problems I solve:** disease subtype classification · drug target identification · somatic variant detection · pathway dysregulation · compound hit prioritization · pipeline bottlenecks

**The standard I hold:** reproducible · statistically rigorous · biologically interpretable · production-ready

## What I Actually Do

```
Raw Data                         Insight
────────                         ───────
FASTQ files          ──▶   QC → Alignment → Variant Calling → Annotation
scRNA-seq counts     ──▶   Normalization → Clustering → Cell Type ID → DEGs
Mass spec outputs    ──▶   LFQ → Protein quantification → Multi-omics fusion
HTS screening data   ──▶   Plate QC → Dose-response → IC50 → Hit ID
Clinical records     ──▶   Cleaning → Modeling → Statistical reports
All of the above     ──▶   Machine learning → Prediction → SHAP → Publication
```

## Four Roles. One Person.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🧬 Bioinformatician
Building end-to-end NGS pipelines that actually run in production. Snakemake workflows on SLURM HPC and AWS Batch. scRNA-seq with Seurat and Scanpy. Somatic variant calling with GATK Mutect2. Differential expression with DESeq2. **30% faster. 26% more throughput.** Not by accident — by design.

**Tools:** Seurat · Scanpy · DESeq2 · STAR · BWA-MEM · GATK · Mutect2 · samtools · bcftools · Snakemake · BaseSpace

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🤖 Data Scientist
Machine learning on biological data — where the features are genes, the labels are disease subtypes, and the stakes are real. Random Forest classifier at **AUC 0.85**. SHAP-based feature importance. 5-fold cross-validation. UMAP and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Models that generalize, not just memorize.

**Tools:** R · Python · randomForest · caret · xgboost · SHAPforxgboost · scikit-learn · pROC

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 📊 Statistical Modeler
Statistics as the backbone of every analysis — not an afterthought. FDR correction on differential expression. LASSO for feature selection. Multivariate regression on clinical datasets. Proper experimental design. Cross-validation that means something. Results rigorous enough to publish and clear enough for a clinician to act on.

**Tools:** R (primary) · DESeq2 · LASSO · logistic regression · PCA · FDR · Biostatistics

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🗄️ Data Analyst
Raw data is almost never clean. Clinical records, formulation datasets, structured databases — every dataset has problems. SQL for querying and validation. Python scripts for integrity checks. QC protocols that catch errors before they propagate. Normalization, transformation, and reporting that R&D teams can trust.

**Tools:** SQL · Python · R · pandas · dplyr · ggplot2 · tidyr · Excel

## Featured Projects

### 🔬 [scRNAseq-cancer-analysis](https://github.com/shipatel302/scRNAseq-cancer-analysis)
**Single-cell RNA-seq pipeline + Machine Learning classifier for HPV+ cancer cohorts**

A complete analysis workflow — from raw count matrices to a validated Random Forest subtype classifier. Built in R using Seurat for preprocessing, DESeq2 for differential expression, and SHAP for model interpretability.

```
QC & Filtering → Normalization → UMAP Clustering → FDR-controlled DEGs
→ Feature Matrix (top 200 DEGs + TMB scores)
→ Random Forest (5-fold CV) → AUC 0.85 → SHAP Feature Importance
```

### ⚙️ [ngs-pipeline-snakemake](https://github.com/shipatel302/ngs-pipeline-snakemake)
**Production-grade NGS pipeline: somatic variant detection + transcriptomic analysis**

A Snakemake workflow covering the full NGS stack — QC, alignment, duplicate marking, base recalibration, Mutect2 variant calling, and DESeq2 differential expression. Deployable on SLURM HPC and AWS Batch. Achieves 30% runtime reduction through parallelization and optimized resource allocation.

```
FastQC → Trimmomatic → BWA-MEM → MarkDuplicates → BQSR
→ Mutect2 → FilterMutectCalls → bcftools merge
→ featureCounts → DESeq2 → MultiQC report
```

### 💊 [hts-drug-screening-analysis](https://github.com/shipatel302/hts-drug-screening-analysis)
**HTS compound screening pipeline for proximity-based drug discovery (PROTACs, molecular glues)**

An R-based pipeline for processing high-throughput screening data — plate QC (Z' factor, SSMD), 4-parameter log-logistic dose-response curve fitting, IC50 estimation with 95% CI, hit identification, and downstream integration with transcriptomic and proteomic data for multi-omics candidate prioritization.

```
Plate QC (Z' factor) → 4PL Dose-Response Fitting → IC50 Estimation
→ Hit Identification → Transcriptomic + Proteomic Integration
→ Composite Prioritization Score → Ranked Candidate List
```
